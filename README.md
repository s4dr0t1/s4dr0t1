### About me
Hey! My name's Rohit and I am a threat detection engineer by trade, currently employed at [CRED](https://cred.club/), where I deal with blue teaming stuff day in and day out (more on this later). I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [MNIT Jaipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaviya_National_Institute_of_Technology,_Jaipur).

I have been ***extremely*** interested in computing from a very young age. I enjoy breaking things down, and then trying to understand how they work from the ground up. Apart from tech stuff, I game, watch anime, and web shows, and hit the gym frequently ;)

In no specific order, my interests include:
- **blue teaming stuff**: detection engineering, incident response, security operations, cloud security, cyber threat intelligence and network security
- **systems and low-level computing**: operating system internals, hypervisors, reverse engineering, computer architecture and trusted computing
- **other security stuff**: cryptography, networking, privacy and digital security
- **other computing interests**: programming language theory, distributed systems, site reliability engineering, parallelism and compilers

Feel free to [reach out](https://s4dr0t1.github.io/contact/) if you'd like to discuss security, collaborate on projects, or share ideas. To get an idea of what things I've been working on recently, check [this](https://s4dr0t1.github.io/now/). Have a good day! :)
